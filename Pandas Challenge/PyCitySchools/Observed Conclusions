Conclusions from PySchool Analysis: 

1. The math scores in district type schools are lacking in comparison to other grades. The math program will need to be reveiwed in district type schools to improve average scores and to ensure more students pass. 

2. Schools with less than 2000 students generally do better than schools with more than 2000 students. Ideally, schools should disperse their students to ensure resources are able to reach every students (i.e. have other students attend schools with less than 1000 students, or build more schools in areas with more students). 

School budget has an inverse relationships with passing students/average grades. This shows that more money does not mean better grades or more passing students.
